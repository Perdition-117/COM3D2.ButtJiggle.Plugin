# COM3D2.ButtJiggle.Plugin

This plugin is in the early testing stages, but feel free to sneak a peek and [download the latest pre-release](https://github.com/luvoid/COM3D2.ButtJiggle.Plugin/releases).

## Requirements
* Requires [BepInEx 5.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)
* Requires [BepInEx.Configuration.Json 0.5.0-alpha](https://github.com/luvoid/BepInEx.Configuration.Json)
* Requires [UniverseUGUI 1.6.3-preview](https://github.com/luvoid/UniverseUGUI)
* Requires [CM3D2.UGUI 0.1.3-preview](https://github.com/luvoid/CM3D2.UGUI)
* Improved physics with [COM3D2.TimeDependentPhysics.Plugin](https://github.com/luvoid/COM3D2.TimeDependentPhysics.Plugin) (optional)

## Conflicts
* **COM3D2.SmoothAnimation** may interfere or override the settings of ButtJiggle.
  If some settings don't seem to work correctly, (e.g. Clothed Stiffness), disable settings in SmoothAnim until it works again.
